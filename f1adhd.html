            <p>People with ADHD often struggle with maintaining focus, staying organized, completing tasks, and regulating their impulses. Inattention symptoms may include difficulty sustaining attention, easily getting distracted, frequently losing things, and struggling to follow through on tasks. Hyperactivity symptoms may manifest as fidgeting, restlessness, talking excessively, and difficulty staying seated. Impulsivity symptoms may include acting without thinking, interrupting others, and having difficulty waiting their turn.</p>
            <p>These challenges can have a significant impact on various aspects of daily life, including academic or work performance, relationships, and self-esteem. Individuals with ADHD may experience frustration, feelings of being overwhelmed, and a sense of underachievement. </p>
            <p>Understanding the specific difficulties associated with ADHD can help individuals and their loved ones develop effective coping mechanisms and seek appropriate professional help. With proper support, individuals with ADHD can learn strategies to manage their symptoms, improve their focus and productivity, and lead fulfilling lives that capitalize on their unique strengths and talents.</p>
